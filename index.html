      <h2>Hi! I'm Stephanie Moore</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student of software development located in the Greater Charlotte Metropolitan Area
        (North/South
        Carolina)</p>
      <p> As a former forester:</p>
      <ol>
        <!--Will create numbered list by default-->
        <li>I am familiar with managing entire ecosystems</li>
        <li>I know the importance of seeing the forest and not just the trees</li>
        <li>I know that while each individual contribution is important, you need a team to manage the ecosystem</li>
      </ol>
      <p> I am excited and ready to use my experiences this new way. Please take a look at my webpage and feel free to
        <a href="mailto:smoore_forestry@outlook.com">contact me!</a>

      <h3>About Stephanie</h3>
      <p>After graduating college with a B.S. in forest resource management, I went on to become a professional
        forester. When the covid-19 pandemic hit and I was laid off, I started exploring other career options and
        found
        a new interest in programming.</p>
      <p>I love the idea of being able to create my own websites to bring some ideas I previously had to life. I also
        think that the programming field has tons of opportunities for projects including many that could pair my
        former
        expertise with my current growing knowledge.</p>
      <p> I hope that my time as a student at Thinkful will prepare me to start my journey as a software developer. If
        you would like to be apart of my post-Thinkful journey, please reach out, I am excited to hear what projects
        you
        have for me. </p>
